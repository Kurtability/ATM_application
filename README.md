Requires a JDK or JRE version 1.8+ installation to run.

Download the executable `jar` file and/or source code from the releases tab (the latest release tagged 1.0 [here](https://github.sydney.edu.au/SOFT2412-2020S2/Assignment2_r12group3/releases/latest)).

Simply double click (yes! that's all you need to do!!) the jar file to run it.

If that doesn't work (or if you simply wanna take a peek at all our dirty output), open up a terminal and run the following command.
```
java -jar path/to/the/jar/file
```
Cheers!
